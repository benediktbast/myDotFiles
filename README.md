# myDotFiles
This is  collection of my personal config files. The files aim to be fully functional on Linux/MacOS/BSD without any other modification.

## .zshrc
My zshell config is split into modules than can be loaded if needed. The pormpt and the git module are made for modern terminals such as iTerm for macOS or any other 256 color terminal like xfce terminal. The colorscheme may not work on oldschool terminals.

## Terminal Colors
To Test you terminal color settings run:
`~/.zsh/colortest.zsh`

## .vimrc
The .vimrc file provides predefined text formatting functions.
 - Linux Style (hardtabs, width = 8 chars)
 - Java Style (whitespaces only, textident width = 4 chars)

Linux Style is default.

There are command aliases to call the functions:
`:Linux`
`:Java`

## You have a good idea?
Tell me about it, and contribute ;)
